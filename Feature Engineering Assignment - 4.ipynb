    "'''Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are both techniques used in machine learning for encoding categorical data into numerical values, but they are used in different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ordinal Encoding:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Ordinal encoding is used when the categorical values have a meaningful order or ranking.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Consider a dataset with a \"Size\" column containing categories like 'Small', 'Medium', 'Large'. These categories have a clear order, where 'Large' is greater than 'Medium', and 'Medium' is greater than 'Small'. Ordinal encoding assigns numerical values to maintain this order, like 1 for 'Small', 2 for 'Medium', and 3 for 'Large'.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder\n",
    "\n",
    "   size_categories = ['Small', 'Medium', 'Large']\n",
    "\n",
    "   ordinal_encoder = OrdinalEncoder(categories=[size_categories])\n",
    "   encoded_sizes = ordinal_encoder.fit_transform([['Medium', 'Small', 'Large']])\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(encoded_sizes)\n",
    "   # Output: [[2. 1. 3.]]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Use Case:** Ordinal encoding is suitable when the categorical values have a clear and meaningful order, such as rankings or levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Label Encoding:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Label encoding is used when the categorical values do not have any inherent order or ranking.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Consider a dataset with a \"Color\" column containing categories like 'Red', 'Green', 'Blue'. These categories don't have a natural order. Label encoding assigns unique numerical labels to each category without considering any order, like 0 for 'Red', 1 for 'Green', and 2 for 'Blue'.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n",
    "\n",
    "   color_labels = ['Red', 'Green', 'Blue']\n",
    "\n",
    "   label_encoder = LabelEncoder()\n",

    "\n",
    "   print(encoded_colors)\n",
    "   # Output: [1 2 0]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Use Case:** Label encoding is suitable when the categorical values don't have a meaningful order, and you just need to convert them into numerical values for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing Between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding:**\n",
    "- Choose **Ordinal Encoding** when the categorical values have a clear order or ranking, and this order is essential for the model to understand the data correctly.\n",
    "- Choose **Label Encoding** when the categorical values don't have a meaningful order, and you just need to convert them into numerical values without introducing any artificial ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding depends on the nature of the categorical data and whether there is a meaningful order among the categories.''"
